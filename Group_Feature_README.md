# Group Feature

Using the group feature, one can form groups on our Mastodon Server. Using groups, a post can be sent to all the members of that group. Those members don't need to follow the person who made the post.

## Group Creation

It is really easy to create a group on our server. Just follow these steps:-
1. Create a normal user with an email, username and password on our server.
2. Open the Mastodon app on your mobile phone and log into our server as the user you just created.
3. Click on the "Profile" button on the bottom right.
4. Click on "Edit profile" button.
5. Go to the "About" tab.
6. Click on "Add row" button.
7. Under "Label" field, enter "Group" and under "Content" field, enter "True".
8. Click on "Save changes" button.

You now have a new Group!

## Posting using the Group

Note:- Only users who follow the group will be able to make a post on the group.

To make a new post using the group, follow the given steps:-
1. Log into you Mastodon account as a user.
2. Make sure you are following the group.
3. Make a post and tag the group in the post by mentioning "@groupname" in the post.

You will see that the user as well as the group will make the post on the current mastodon server. All the followers of the group will be able to see the group's post.

3. Click on "Edit profile" button.
